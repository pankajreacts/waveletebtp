# waveletebtp
This project was done by mechanical engineering students of IIT Roorkee in their BTech project.
Fault detection of ball bearing is an important issue. Wavelet analysis can be used for detecting fault in the bearing. The matlab code here is written for formatting data into different format, extracting features and finally training and testing using Support Vector Machine(SVM) on vibration data. Data is taken from Case Western Reserve University.
